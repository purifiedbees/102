        WELCOME TO 'HUNT THE WUMPUS'
        THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 20 ROOMS. EACH ROOM
        HAS 3 TUNNELS LEADING TO OTHER ROOMS.
        
    HAZARDS:
        BOTTOMLESS PITS: TWO ROOMS HAVE BOTTOMLESS PITS IN THEM
        IF YOU GO THERE, YOU FALL INTO THE PIT (& LOSE!)
        SUPER BATS: TWO OTHER ROOMS HAVE SUPER BATS. IF YOU
        GO THERE, A BAT GRABS YOU AND TAKES YOU TO SOME OTHER
        ROOM AT RANDOM, WHICH CAN BE A PIT OR WHERE THE WUMPUS IS
    WUMPUS:
        THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY THE HAZARDS (HE HAS SUCKER
        FEET AND IS TOO BIG FOR A BAT TO LIFT). USUALLY
        HE IS ASLEEP. TWO THINGS THAT WAKE HIM UP: YOU ENTERING
        HIS ROOM OR YOU SHOOTING AN ARROW.
        IF THE WUMPUS WAKES, HE EITHER MOVES ONE ROOM
        OR STAYS STILL. AFTER THAT, IF HE IS WHERE YOU
        ARE, HE TRAMPLES YOU (& YOU LOSE!).
    YOU:
        EACH TURN YOU MAY MOVE OR SHOOT AN ARROW
        MOVING: YOU CAN GO ONE ROOM (THRU ONE TUNNEL)
        ARROWS: YOU HAVE 5 ARROWS. YOU LOSE WHEN YOU RUN
        OUT. YOU AIM BY TELLING
        THE COMPUTER THE ROOM YOU WANT THE ARROW TO GO TO.
        IF THE ARROW HITS THE WUMPUS, YOU WIN. ARROWS CAN
        ONLY TRAVEL THROUGH 5 ROOMS UNTIL IT HITS THE GROUND.

    WARNINGS:
        WHEN YOU ARE ONE ROOM AWAY FROM WUMPUS OR A HAZARD,
        THE COMPUTER SAYS:
        WUMPUS:   'YOU SMELL A WUMPUS'
        BAT   :   'THERE ARE BATS NEAR BY'
        PIT   :   'YOU FEEL A DRAFT'
